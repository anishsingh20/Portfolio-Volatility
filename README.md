# Portfolio-Volatility
Volatility is a formal measure of a stock's risks. The higher the volatility of a stock, the greater its up and down swings. The volatility of a portfolio of stocks, on the other hand, is a measure of how wildly the total value of all the stocks in that portfolio appreciates or declines.
